And as such, the precedence of openness and admitting ones failures goes above the importance of maintaining the status quo.
…the importance of things being said.</p><p>However in Hong Kong, as well as many other cultures, (UK, Australia…) I noticed that the success and failure of some companies isn’t with what was being said. But with what was not being said.
I think back to the working relationship I had with these colleagues, and I’ll admit, that it wasn’t the most pleasant.</p><p>Maybe it was because I wasn’t more pleasant enough, or maybe I should’ve been more soft spoken.
Whatever the case, it’s difficult to prevent that method of thinking when there multiple facets to every story.</p><h2 id="tips-to-get-past-the-lone-wolf-mentality"><a href="#tips-to-get-past-the-lone-wolf-mentality" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> tips to get past the lone wolf mentality</h2><ul><li>develop self awareness</li></ul><p>ask yourself this - if you feel uncomfortable about your work,
is it the work itself or the people around you?
do the people around affect your focus and do they bring you down?</p><ul><li><p>take a moment and walk out of that environment, after 5 minutes away:
do you still feel uncomfortable? (if no, then it's the environment, if yes, then the environment has either affected you, or you are carrying something negative).</p></li><li><p>there is a theoretical limit to how you can build good software,
not matter how great you are, there is an upper threshold to creating great software.
so if there an upper limit to a single developer,
how can one become a great developer with respect to a team? develop empathy.</p></li><li><p>the people around you can help you, ask questions, they are willing to help</p></li><li><p>for a lot of people, they look for the smartest people, but there is no mythical place where the smartest people live.
