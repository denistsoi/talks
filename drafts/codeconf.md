# From Junior to Senior Developer: Lone Wolf to Wolf Pack

We will investigate the path of becoming a Senior Developer;  
such as forming attributes that define a successful developer,  
as well as developing frameworks to self-evaluate and  
improve upon your career progression.  

From there, we will then touch upon how to call upon others  
to form packs that will help influence the culture of the company,  
as well as forming bonds and support networks   
to creating a positive and sustainable work environment.

# what is a senior developer

- someone that can use _*constant_* effort to solve a problem  
- high skillset/knowledge

a senior is looked upon the company to solve problems,  
from an executive level (to produce results) 
as well as from witin the team (to assist and provide mentorship).

but the problem with this is that, 
"senior" is often given to developer with less than 10 years experience.

What's wrong with this picture...

developers aren't given the opportunity to become 15 year seniors
(most leave to become managers)

-> unsustainable code productivity

(attention span)

-> senior developers know what problems what not to solve
(i.e. you dont need developers to do 10x faster, you just need developers that know what not to do 10x the time)


-> 15 year illusionary track, shift track to 45 years
-> get advisors
-> find your passion

## what should you do when you realise you are a lone wolf?

### 
- develop self awareness  
- accept responsibility if you are acting as a lone wolf out of selfishness  
- understand what environment would allow you to thrive

### Permission to perform

In the States, as outsiders, we are made to believe that the success and failure of an individual is judged upon the merit of that persons ability. And as such, the precedence of openness and admitting ones failures goes above the importance of maintaining the status quo.
…the importance of things being said.

However in Hong Kong, as well as many other cultures, (UK, Australia…) I noticed that the success and failure of some companies isn’t with what was being said. But with what was not being said.
I think back to the working relationship I had with these colleagues, and I’ll admit, that it wasn’t the most pleasant.

Maybe it was because I wasn’t more pleasant enough, or maybe I should’ve been more soft spoken.
Whatever the case, it’s difficult to prevent that method of thinking when there multiple facets to every story.

## tips to get past the lone wolf mentality

- develop self awareness

ask yourself this - if you feel uncomfortable about your work,
is it the work itself or the people around you?
do the people around affect your focus and do they bring you down?

- take a moment and walk out of that environment, after 5 minutes away:
do you still feel uncomfortable? (if no, then it's the environment, if yes, then the environment has either affected you, or you are carrying something negative).

- there is a theoretical limit to how you can build good software, 
not matter how great you are, there is an upper threshold to creating great software.
so if there an upper limit to a single developer,
how can one become a great developer with respect to a team? develop empathy.


- the people around you can help you, ask questions, they are willing to help
- for a lot of people, they look for the smartest people, but there is no mythical place where the smartest people live. The smartest people know that being nice and having people skills are important.

# How can you develop a team that shares the same beliefs as you?

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHNN9ItVwAIWHIp.jpg)

- be open about your values, your desires, as well as taking an interest in your team. 
- (what are their values, what do they wish to achieve, and hold yourself and your team accountable).
- align with your team on a regular basis, dont leave them out. even when you're having a shit day.
- support your team and be ensure they know they can gain support from you.
- if someone needs to OT, support them, even if you can't help them (i.e. grab them dinner etc).

### other tips

Q: how will i know who is the most senior person in a company?

If you are unable to answer this question, then you (and someone on the same level/experience) may in fact be the most _mature_ and therefore have to lead.

Q: how will i know whether the company I work for is interested in my inputs?

take on roles/tasks that involve more responsibility that you are not immediately tasked with.

Q: my co-workers keep leaving, what should I do?

ask difficult/uncomfortable questions, *why are people leaving?* what is causing people to leave your team? - if there is a problem, what have you done to reolsve those issues?
