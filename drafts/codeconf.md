"When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives" - Winter is coming.

- background:

It was 2013 when I approached Mart for a entry development position. A few months passed and his company was going through some trouble, he approached me to say that he was teaching a programming class for this company called General Assembly. 

The pup stage - 

tips to not get trapped in the how to survive past the lone wolf mentality
- the people around you are your resources, ask questions, they are willing to help
- there is no mythical place where the smartest people are residing, people move and migrate, and ultimately, the ones who are the most known may not be the smartest in the room. (and that's ok, you can still learn soemthing from them)
- work is the currency to benchmark your value
- code challenges are a necessary evil, but a work referral is worth it's weight in gold.

The adolecent wolf

signs:
- cocky, has an air of invinciblity

From Junior to Senior Developer: Lone Wolf to Wolf Pack

---

We will investigate the path of becoming a Senior Developer;
such as forming attributes that define a successful developer,
as well as developing frameworks to self-evaluate and
improve upon your career progression.

From there, we will then touch upon how to call upon others 
to form packs that will help influence the culture of the company, 
as well as forming bonds and support networks 
to creating a positive and sustainable work environment.

- How can you develop a team that shares the same beliefs as you?

be open about your values, your desires, as well as taking an interest in your team members. (what are their values, what do they wish to achieve, and hold yourself and your team accountable to those milestones).



Q: how will i know who is the most senior person in a company?

If you are unable to answer this question, then you (and someone on the same level/experience) may in fact be the most _mature_ and therefore have to lead.

Q: how will i know whether the company I work for is interested in my inputs?

take on roles/tasks that involve more responsibility that you are not immediately tasked with.

The importance of Empathy

mpj - fun fun function https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9OpTNk0hYc

how to be a good developer?

there is a theoretical limit to how you can build good software, 
not matter how great you are, there is an upper threshold to creating great software.

so if there an upper limit to a single developer,
how can one become a great developer with respect to a team?

the need for empathy.


Two colleagues from my team left recently, and it made me think about the differences between how I think and of those around me.

For a majority of my career, working in software, I have been involved with numerous startups, either as an employee or as a consultant. And for every one that has failed, or beginning to show signs of cracking, I have begun to recognise a pattern




In the States, as outsiders, we are made to believe that the success and failure of an individual is judged upon the merit of that persons ability. And as such, the precedence of openness and admitting ones failures goes above the importance of maintaining the status quo.
…the importance of things being said.

However in Hong Kong, as well as many other cultures, (UK, Australia…) I noticed that the success and failure of some companies isn’t with what was being said. But with what was not being said.
I think back to the working relationship I had with these colleagues, and I’ll admit, that it wasn’t the most pleasant.

Maybe it was because I wasn’t more pleasant enough, or maybe I should’ve been more soft spoken.
Whatever the case, it’s difficult to prevent that method of thinking when there multiple facets to every story.
